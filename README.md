## **About**

This game consists of quickly and randomly exchanging positions, three cards that are initially shown to the user "face up" and are exchanged several times "face down". The participant must guess, after the exchanges, which of the three cards is the queen of hearts (one of the cards is always the queen of hearts, the other two can be any card). When the contestant selects the card that assumes the queen of hearts to be on, the cards are again turned “face up” so that the contestant can see if it was correct or not.
